#  Trail Finder

```
Weekend is around the corner or maybe it's your day off and you
feel like hiking! Our app main goal was to help you find a trail
that's close to you. For your convenience, we have also included
the weather condition as well as some other important details about
the trail. So, what are you waiting for.
